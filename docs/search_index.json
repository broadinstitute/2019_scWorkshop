In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq processing, starting from the raw reads coming off the sequencer. The course includes common analysis strategies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss the central biological questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq. 1.2 TARGETED AUDIENCE &amp; ASSUMED BACKGROUND This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The material is suitable both for experimentalists who want to learn more about data-analysis as well as computational biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any experimental protocol or biological system. The requirements for this course are: 1. Working knowledge of unix (managing files, running programs) 2. Programming experience in R (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). Bioconductor experience is a plus. 3. Familiarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data) 1.3 COURSE FORMAT The course will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will include a lecture and laboratory component. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will be done using a combination of tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed via web browser. 1.4 Getting Started 1.5 SESSION CONTENT 1.5.1 Monday – Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 (lunch break-1 hr, 40 min of total coffee breaks) 1.5.1.1 Lecture 1 – scRNA-Seq experimental design (1 hour, Orr) Overview of course (intros, 20 min) General introduction: HCA/KCO overview Comparison of Bulk and single cell RNA-Seq Overview of available scRNA-seq technologies (10x) and experimental protocols scRNA-Seq experimental design and analysis workflow? 1.5.1.2 Lab 1 – Understanding sequencing raw data (Kirk, 1.5-2 hours) Lab based around data wrangling from public data repositories: get data from 10x website, single cell portal, from GEO (fastqs, counts) Shell and Unix commands to navigate directories, create folders, open files Raw file formats 1.5.1.3 Lecture 2 - Intro to Data processing: from bcl file to bam file (1 hour, Dana) scRNA-Seq processing workflow starting with choice of sequencer (NextSeq, HiSeq, MiSeq) / barcode swapping and bcl files Overview of Popular tools and algorithms Common single-cell analyses and interpretation Sequencing data: alignment and quality control Looking at cool things in alignment like where reads are, mutations, splicing 1.5.1.4 Lab 2 – Processing raw scRNA-Seq data (Dana, no R at this point) Data outputs from different scRNAseq technologies (10x, Smart-seq2) - process both?

Are there parts that supposed to be in labs 1 or 3? Demultiplexing FastQC Align (STAR/TOPHAT/Kallisto) IGViewer - what do we want here? I use it for mutation detections, copying sequences, searching for alternative splicing. Flash talks (1.5 hr, break into 2 groups of 13) small presentation about your genome assembly and annotation project, ideally do 3 slides -2/3 mins (powerpoint or similar).

I believe this is something very productive and helpful because it is a kind of wrap-up and brainstorming session. Normally, ppl love to talk and present something and in this way they/we can be 100% sure they really understood the different steps of the pipeline.
