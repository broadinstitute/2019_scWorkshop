In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq processing, starting from the raw reads coming off the sequencer. The course includes common analysis strategies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss the central biological questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq. 1.2 TARGETED AUDIENCE &amp; ASSUMED BACKGROUND This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The material is suitable both for experimentalists who want to learn more about data-analysis as well as computational biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any experimental protocol or biological system. The requirements for this course are: 1. Working knowledge of unix (managing files, running programs) 2. Programming experience in R (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). Bioconductor experience is a plus. 3. Familiarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data) 1.3 COURSE FORMAT The course will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will include a lecture and laboratory component. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will be done using a combination of tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed via web browser. 1.4 Getting Started 1.5 SESSION CONTENT 1.5.1 Monday – Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 (lunch break-1 hr, 40 min of total coffee breaks) 1.5.1.1 Lecture 1 – scRNA-Seq experimental design (1 hour, Orr) Overview of course (intros, 20 min) General introduction: HCA/KCO overview Comparison of Bulk and single cell RNA-Seq Overview of available scRNA-seq technologies (10x) and experimental protocols scRNA-Seq experimental design and analysis workflow? 1.5.1.2 Lab 1 – Understanding sequencing raw data (Kirk, 1.5-2 hours) Lab based around data wrangling from public data repositories: get data from 10x website, single cell portal, from GEO (fastqs, counts) Shell and Unix commands to navigate directories, create folders, open files Raw file formats 1.5.1.3 Lecture 2 - Intro to Data processing: from bcl file to bam file (1 hour, Dana) scRNA-Seq processing workflow starting with choice of sequencer (NextSeq, HiSeq, MiSeq) / barcode swapping and bcl files Overview of Popular tools and algorithms Common single-cell analyses and interpretation Sequencing data: alignment and quality control Looking at cool things in alignment like where reads are, mutations, splicing 1.5.1.4 Lab 2 – Processing raw scRNA-Seq data (Dana, no R at this point) Data outputs from different scRNAseq technologies (10x, Smart-seq2) - process both?

I believe this is something very productive and helpful because it is a kind of wrap-up and brainstorming session. Normally, ppl love to talk and present something and in this way they/we can be 100% sure they really understood the different steps of the pipeline.

["introduction-rbioconductor.html", "7 Introduction R/Bioconductor 7.1 Installing packages 7.2 Installation instructions: 7.3 Data-types/classes 7.4 Basic data structures 7.5 More information", " 7 Introduction R/Bioconductor Presentation 7.1 Installing packages 7.1.1 CRAN The Comprehensive R Archive Network CRAN is the biggest archive of R packages. There are few requirements for uploading packages besides building and installing succesfully, hence documentation and support is often minimal and figuring how to use these packages can be a challenge it itself. CRAN is the default repository R will search to find packages to install: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) require(&quot;devtools&quot;) 7.1.2 Github Github isn’t specific to R, any code of any type in any state can be uploaded. There is no guarantee a package uploaded to github will even install, nevermind do what it claims to do. R packages can be downloaded and installed directly from github using the “devtools” package installed above. devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3Drop&quot;) Github is also a version control system which stores multiple versions of any package. By default the most recent “master” version of the package is installed. If you want an older version or the development branch this can be specified using the “ref” parameter: # different branch devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3D&quot;, ref=&quot;nbumi&quot;) # previous commit devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3Drop&quot;, ref=&quot;434d2da28254acc8de4940c1dc3907ac72973135&quot;) Note: make sure you re-install the M3Drop master branch for later in the course. 7.1.3 Bioconductor Bioconductor is a repository of R-packages specifically for biological analyses. It has the strictest requirements for submission, including installation on every platform and full documentation with a tutorial (called a vignette) explaining how the package should be used. Bioconductor also encourages utilization of standard data structures/classes and coding style/naming conventions, so that, in theory, packages and analyses can be combined into large pipelines or workflows. source(&quot;https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&quot;) biocLite(&quot;edgeR&quot;) Note: in some situations it is necessary to substitute “http://” for “https://” in the above depending on the security features of your internet connection/network. Bioconductor also requires creators to support their packages and has a regular 6-month release schedule. Make sure you are using the most recent release of bioconductor before trying to install packages for the course. source(&quot;https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&quot;) biocLite(&quot;BiocUpgrade&quot;) 7.1.4 Source The final way to install packages is directly from source. In this case you have to download a fully built source code file, usually packagename.tar.gz, or clone the github repository and rebuild the package yourself. Generally this will only be done if you want to edit a package yourself, or if for some reason the former methods have failed. install.packages(&quot;M3Drop_3.05.00.tar.gz&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;) 7.2 Installation instructions: All the packages necessary for this course are available here. Starting from “RUN Rscript -e”install.packages(‘devtools’)&quot; “, run each of the commands (minus”RUN“) on the command line or start an R session and run each of the commands within the quotation marks. Note the ordering of the installation is important in some cases, so make sure you run them in order from top to bottom. 7.3 Data-types/classes R is a high level language so the underlying data-type is generally not important. The exception if you are accessing R data directly using another language such as C, but that is beyond the scope of this course. Instead we will consider the basic data classes: numeric, integer, logical, and character, and the higher level data class called “factor”. You can check what class your data is using the “class()” function. Aside: R can also store data as “complex” for complex numbers but generally this isn’t relevant for biological analyses. 7.3.1 Numeric The “numeric” class is the default class for storing any numeric data - integers, decimal numbers, numbers in scientific notation, etc… x = 1.141 class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; y = 42 class(y) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; z = 6.02e23 class(z) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Here we see that even though R has an “integer” class and 42 could be stored more efficiently as an integer the default is to store it as “numeric”. If we want 42 to be stored as an integer we must “coerce” it to that class: y = as.integer(42) class(y) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; Coercion will force R to store data as a particular class, if our data is incompatible with that class it will still do it but the data will be converted to NAs: as.numeric(&quot;H&quot;) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion ## [1] NA Above we tried to coerce “character” data, identified by the double quotation marks, into numeric data which doesn’t make sense, so we triggered (“threw”) an warning message. Since this is only a warning R would continue with any subsequent commands in a script/function, whereas an “error” would cause R to halt. 7.3.2 Character/String The “character” class stores all kinds of text data. Programing convention calls data containing multiple letters a “string”, thus most R functions which act on character data will refer to the data as “strings” and will often have “str” or “string” in it’s name. Strings are identified by being flanked by double quotation marks, whereas variable/function names are not: x = 5 a = &quot;x&quot; # character &quot;x&quot; a ## [1] &quot;x&quot; b = x # variable x b ## [1] 5 In addition to standard alphanumeric characters, strings can also store various special characters. Special characters are identified using a backlash followed by a single character, the most relevant are the special character for tab : \\t and new line : \\n. To demonstrate the these special characters lets concatenate (cat) together two strings with these characters separating (sep) them: cat(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot; &quot;) ## Hello World cat(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\t&quot;) ## Hello World cat(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Hello ## World Note that special characters work differently in different functions. For instance the paste function does the same thing as cat but does not recognize special characters. paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot; &quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello World&quot; paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\t&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello\\tWorld&quot; paste(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, sep= &quot;\\n&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello\\nWorld&quot; Single or double backslash is also used as an escape character to turn off special characters or allow quotation marks to be included in strings: cat(&quot;This \\&quot;string\\&quot; contains quotation marks.&quot;) ## This &quot;string&quot; contains quotation marks. Special characters are generally only used in pattern matching, and reading/writing data to files. For instance this is how you would read a tab-separated file into R. dat = read.delim(&quot;file.tsv&quot;, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;) Another special type of character data are colours. Colours can be specified in three main ways: by name from those available, by red, green, blue values using the rgb function, and by hue (colour), saturation (colour vs white) and value (colour/white vs black) using the hsv function. By default rgb and hsv expect three values in 0-1 with an optional fourth value for transparency. Alternatively, sets of predetermined colours with useful properties can be loaded from many different packages with RColorBrewer being one of the most popular. reds = c(&quot;red&quot;, rgb(1,0,0), hsv(0, 1, 1)) reds ## [1] &quot;red&quot; &quot;#FF0000&quot; &quot;#FF0000&quot; barplot(c(1,1,1), col=reds, names=c(&quot;by_name&quot;, &quot;by_rgb&quot;, &quot;by_hsv&quot;)) 7.3.3 Logical The logical class stores boolean truth values, i.e. TRUE and FALSE. It is used for storing the results of logical operations and conditional statements will be coerced to this class. Most other data-types can be coerced to boolean without triggering (or “throwing”) error messages, which may cause unexpected behaviour. x = TRUE class(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; y = &quot;T&quot; as.logical(y) ## [1] TRUE z = 5 as.logical(z) ## [1] TRUE x = FALSE class(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; y = &quot;F&quot; as.logical(y) ## [1] FALSE z = 0 as.logical(z) ## [1] FALSE Exercise 1 Experiment with other character and numeric values, which are coerced to TRUE or FALSE? which are coerced to neither? Do you ever throw a warning/error message? 7.3.4 Factors String/Character data is very memory inefficient to store, each letter generally requires the same amount of memory as any integer. Thus when storing a vector of strings with repeated elements it is more efficient assign each element to an integer and store the vector as integers and an additional string-to-integer association table. Thus, by default R will read in text columns of a data table as factors. str_vector = c(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;) factored_vector = factor(str_vector) factored_vector ## [1] Apple Apple Banana Banana Banana Carrot Carrot Apple Banana ## Levels: Apple Banana Carrot as.numeric(factored_vector) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 The double nature of factors can cause some unintuitive behaviour. E.g. joining two factors together will convert them to the numeric form and the original strings will be lost. c(factored_vector, factored_vector) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 Likewise if due to formatting issues numeric data is mistakenly interpretted as strings, then you must convert the factor back to strings before coercing to numeric values: x = c(&quot;20&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;38&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, &quot;40&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;30&quot;) x = factor(x) as.numeric(x) ## [1] 1 3 2 5 1 6 3 4 as.numeric(as.character(x)) ## [1] 20 25 23 38 20 40 25 30 To make R read text as character data instead of factors set the environment option stringsAsFactors=FALSE. This must be done at the start of each R session. options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE) Exercise How would you use factors to create a vector of colours for an arbitrarily long vector of fruits like str_vector above? Answer 7.3.5 Checking class/type We recommend checking your data is of the correct class after reading from files: x = 1.4 is.numeric(x) ## [1] TRUE is.character(x) ## [1] FALSE is.logical(x) ## [1] FALSE is.factor(x) ## [1] FALSE 7.4 Basic data structures So far we have only looked at single values and vectors. Vectors are the simplest data structure in R. They are a 1-dimensional array of data all of the same type. If the input when creating a vector is of different types it will be coerced to the data-type that is most consistent with the data. x = c(&quot;Hello&quot;, 5, TRUE) x ## [1] &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Here we tried to put character, numeric and logical data into a single vector so all the values were coerced to character data. A matrix is the two dimensional version of a vector, it also requires all data to be of the same type. If we combine a character vector and a numeric vector into a matrix, all the data will be coerced to characters: x = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) y = c(1, 2, 3) class(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(y) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; m = cbind(x, y) m ## x y ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;2&quot; ## [3,] &quot;C&quot; &quot;3&quot; The quotation marks indicate that the numeric vector has been coerced to characters. Alternatively, to store data with columns of different data-types we can use a dataframe. z = data.frame(x, y) z ## x y ## 1 A 1 ## 2 B 2 ## 3 C 3 class(z[,1]) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(z[,2]) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; If you have set stringsAsFactors=FALSE as above you will find the first column remains characters, otherwise it will be automatically converted to a factor. options(stringsAsFactors=TRUE) z = data.frame(x, y) class(z[,1]) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; Another difference between matrices and dataframes is the ability to select columns using the $ operator: m$x # throws an error z$x # ok The final basic data structure is the list. Lists allow data of different types and different lengths to be stored in a single object. Each element of a list can be any other R object : data of any type, any data structure, even other lists or functions. l = list(m, z) ll = list(sublist=l, a_matrix=m, numeric_value=42, this_string=&quot;Hello World&quot;, even_a_function=cbind) ll ## $sublist ## $sublist[[1]] ## x y ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;2&quot; ## [3,] &quot;C&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## ## $sublist[[2]] ## x y ## 1 A 1 ## 2 B 2 ## 3 C 3 ## ## ## $a_matrix ## x y ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;2&quot; ## [3,] &quot;C&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## ## $numeric_value ## [1] 42 ## ## $this_string ## [1] &quot;Hello World&quot; ## ## $even_a_function ## function (..., deparse.level = 1) ## .Internal(cbind(deparse.level, ...)) ## &lt;bytecode: 0x1021b1838&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; Lists are most commonly used when returning a large number of results from a function that do not fit into any of the previous data structures. 7.5 More information You can get more information about any R commands relevant to these datatypes using by typing ?function in an interactive session.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 20.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 20.1.
